Task 2: Sales Dashboard using Power BI
For Task 2, I created an interactive sales dashboard using Power BI. I used a merged dataset combining product, brand, region, and sales details. I created visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, cards, and tables to show total sales, sales by brand, and regional performance. Filters were added for interactivity, allowing easy data exploration. This task helped me gain practical experience with data modeling, visual storytelling, and dashboard aesthetics.
